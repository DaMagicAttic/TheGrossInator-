# Welcome to... THE GROSSINATOR!


This is a little program I made that lets the user any input they want and the program will output an audio file of your input being described as gross ie. Gross Object: Vomit | GROSSINATOR: Oh gross, vomit

sorry for all the mac and linux users but I do not know if this program can work on either platforms, in theory it should but I have only tested it on Windows

## I recommend running this program on the Command Line and VSCode

#### How to run through Command Line:
CD into the TheGrossInator folder

Type in ```python OhGross.py```
